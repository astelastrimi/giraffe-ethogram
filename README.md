# Giraffe Ethogram Project

Welcome to the Collaborative Digital Giraffe Ethogram! This project aims to build a detailed, peer-reviewed ethogram (a catalog of behaviors) for giraffes (*Giraffa camelopardalis*). Inspired by my studies as a zoologist and my up-close observations at Disney's Animal Kingdom, this repository serves as a structured, collaborative environment for documenting giraffe behaviors.

Our workflow:
1. Individual observations are logged as GitHub Issues.
2. Each issue details a specific behavior with scientific description, context, and interpretation.
3. Promising observations are curated into a master ethogram via Pull Requests.
4. The final ethogram is published as a living document for researchers and enthusiasts.

Join us in documenting the fascinating world of giraffes!
